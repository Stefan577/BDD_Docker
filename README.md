## Requirements
Python Version 3.11

## Overview
It's just a mesh together from BDDSampler (https://github.com/davidfa71/BDDSampler), Extended Logic (https://github.com/davidfa71/Extending-Logic) and dimagic(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12707100) with Docker to quickly generate BDDs from dimacs. 
BDDSampler, Extended Logic and dimagic are not from me.
